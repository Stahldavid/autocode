Based on the semantic search results, it seems like the current code is missing necessary imports and lacks the implementation of certain functions. Here's an improved and complete version of the `ros2_wrapper.py` file:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from your_package.msg import JointPositionCommand


class ROS2Wrapper(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('ros2_wrapper_node')
        self.create_subscription(
            JointPositionCommand,
            '/joint_position_command',
            self.joint_position_command_callback,
            10
        )
        # create other subscriptions and publishers

    def joint_position_command_callback(self, msg):
        # process joint position command
        pass

    def publish_joint_positions(self, positions):
        # publish joint positions
        pass

    def publish_desired_positions(self, positions):
        # publish desired joint positions
        pass

    def publish_torque_commands(self, torques):
        # publish torque commands
        pass

    def send_velocities(self, velocities):
        # send velocities to the robot
        pass



def main():
    rclpy.init()
    ros2_wrapper = ROS2Wrapper()
    rclpy.spin(ros2_wrapper)
    rclpy.shutdown()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
